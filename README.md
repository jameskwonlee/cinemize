# cinemize

by James Kwon Lee

Cinemize is an aspect ratio filter and automatic color corrector that makes regular images appear more cinematic. 

To get started, install pillow:
```
pip install pillow
```

Also, include the simpleimage.py file in your project folder. 
You can apply filters to any image of your choice, just place the image in the project folder. 
Reference the name of the image file under the IMAGE constant, in "quotes". 

After that, run the code and follow prompts in the console to pick your very own cinema filter!
